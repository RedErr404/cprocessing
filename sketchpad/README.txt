Type "./new.sh sketchname" in a terminal in this directory to create a new blank sketch,
then type "cd sketchname" to go to that directory.
Typing "make" will compile your sketch which you can run by typing "./sketchname"
Do not change Makefile unless you know what you are doing,
and edit main.cpp to your hearts content.

If you are having errors compiling a brand new sketch this means cprocessing is not set
up correctly, please see the README.TXT file in the main cprocessing directory.
