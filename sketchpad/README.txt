Type "./new.sh sketchname" in a terminal in this directory to create a new blank sketch,
then type "cd sketchname" to go to that directory.
Typing "make" will compile your sketch which you can run by typing "./sketchname"
Do not change Makefile unless you know what you are doing,
and edit main.cpp to your hearts content.

The files .Makefile.dar, .Makefile.lin, and .Makefile.win get copied to your new sketch folder based on the operating system you use, .main.cpp is the same no matter what.

If you are having errors compiling a brand new sketch this means cprocessing is not set
up correctly, please see the README.TXT file in the main cprocessing directory.
